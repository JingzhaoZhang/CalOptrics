CalOptrics
==========

CalOptrics is an open source fast and easy-to-use C++ library for CUDA-based GPU computing. It uses an array-based function set which makes programming with CUDA easier than programming raw CUDA code, so it's main goal is to save time during gpu code development. The idea for CalOptrics was inspired by the GPU computing library ArrayFire: http://arrayfire.com/ which has an amazing although not open source C++ library which is what inspired the development of CalOptrics. The goal was for this codebase to be designed in an intelligent manner (using Object-oriented and abstraction techniques like interfaces to make modifications to raw lower-level implementations simple and quick and requiring no change to the code above it that uses it since that code will use the interfaces).

I hope that a clean design strategy like this will encourage others to join, contribute, and improve upon any of the present implementations in the project so that if I leave the project, others will carry it on.
