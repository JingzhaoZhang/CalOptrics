CalOptrics
==========

CalOptrics is an open source fast and easy-to-use C++ library for CUDA-based GPU computing. It uses an array-based function set which makes programming with CUDA easier than programming raw CUDA code, so it's main goal is to save time during gpu code development. The idea for CalOptrics was inspired by the GPU computing library ArrayFire: http://arrayfire.com/ which is an amazing although not free which is what inspired the development of CalOptrics.
